# JS3D
A vanilla javascript 3D engine.

To use, add a canvas element with the tag "canvas" to your HTML, and then include the JS3D script.
Models can then be constructed using the basic primitives. For an example of making a model, refer to the Ship function in index.js.
Models can then be used by calling the translate method of the model to translate it, and the rotate method to rotate it. They can be rendered onto the canvas by calling the draw method of the model.

In the example page, the canvas is set to take up the entire page, and the camera can be moved around with the Q, W, E, A, S, and D keys. The camera can be turned by using the U, I, O, J, K, and L keys.

I have probably done an awful job of explaining this, so look at the index.html and index.js files to see an example project (outlined in the paragraph above).
